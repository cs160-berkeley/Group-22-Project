The user story we wanted to implement in this iteration is the login page. 
The customer wanted a clear, easy login and signup page for members where 
they can sign up using name, email, major, and password, and a straightforward
login page where they can just use their recently created signup page to login. 
This involved using the devise gem so we could set up a page that would represent
all the different pages necessary to create an account. We also added the logo 
to make it easy. 

This is important to the customer so they can have people sign up as members, 
which will allow them to track hours and see events on the calendar. We did 
have to modify this expectation because implementing a home page was a bit
more complicated after the customer meeting. He wanted more features to be
implemented on the home page, so we need to set up the database first
before going any further. That is our new goal.
