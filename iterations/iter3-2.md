We also want a member management page that shows all of the members in the clubs. 
Only officers should be able to update the status of the member, their total hours, 
their semester hours, and pick certain members to the member of the month. 

Something that changed was the gallery page. We were close to finishing it, but due
to the time constraints of this iteration, we focused on the event database and setting
that portion up. We created a model and database that would store name, date, location, 
along with an association to the user.
