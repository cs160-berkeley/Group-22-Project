We want a gallery page that displays all of the photos that the club wishes to post. 
The only people with this functionality should be officers, who can upload and delete
photos based on their choosing. We also want members to be able to like photos, and have
those photos show up on their gallery section. 

We also want a member management page that shows all of the members in the clubs. 
Only officers should be able to update the status of the member, their total hours, 
their semester hours, and pick certain members to the member of the month.
